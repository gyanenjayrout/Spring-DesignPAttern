# Spring-DesignPAttern
Spring Design Patterns Spring is a powerful framework that not only simplifies dependency injection and inversion of control but also encourages the use of various design patterns that make Java applications more modular, scalable, and maintainable. Here are some of the essential design patterns often used with Spring
1. Singleton Pattern
•	Definition: Ensures that only one instance of a class exists in the application.
•	Usage in Spring: By default, Spring beans are singletons within the application context, meaning a single instance is created and shared.
•	Example: Defining a Spring-managed bean with @Scope("singleton") (which is actually the default scope) ensures that Spring manages it as a singleton.
2. Factory Pattern
•	Definition: Provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object.
•	Usage in Spring: Spring’s BeanFactory and ApplicationContext work as factories to create and manage beans, allowing flexibility in choosing bean implementations based on configuration.
•	Example: A FactoryBean interface in Spring lets you create custom factories to instantiate beans with complex initialization.
3. Prototype Pattern
•	Definition: Allows creating multiple instances of a class (non-singleton).
•	Usage in Spring: By setting a bean’s scope to @Scope("prototype"), Spring creates a new instance each time it is requested.
•	Example: Useful for stateless beans where multiple independent instances are needed.
4. Proxy Pattern
•	Definition: Controls access to an object by using a proxy that acts as an intermediary.
•	Usage in Spring: Spring AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) uses proxies to intercept and manage method calls, often for cross-cutting concerns like logging, transaction management, or security.
•	Example: With @Transactional annotations, Spring creates a proxy to handle transactional behavior, committing or rolling back as needed.
5. Observer Pattern
•	Definition: A design pattern in which an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of state changes.
•	Usage in Spring: The ApplicationEventPublisher and @EventListener annotations implement the observer pattern, allowing beans to listen for and react to events within the application context.
•	Example: Publishing a custom event when a new user is registered, and listening for it to send a welcome email.
6. Template Method Pattern
•	Definition: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to implement specific steps.
•	Usage in Spring: The JdbcTemplate and RestTemplate classes provide standardized workflows for database operations and REST calls while allowing flexibility in handling specific details.
•	Example: JdbcTemplate manages opening/closing database connections, but users can specify SQL queries.
7. Strategy Pattern
•	Definition: Allows selecting an algorithm’s behavior at runtime.
•	Usage in Spring: Dependency injection in Spring enables you to inject different implementations of an interface based on configuration or runtime logic.
•	Example: Defining multiple sorting strategies and injecting the one that’s currently required into a service class.
8. Decorator Pattern
•	Definition: Extends or alters the functionality of an object at runtime.
•	Usage in Spring: The BeanPostProcessor interface in Spring allows post-processing of beans, enabling you to wrap or add additional behavior to a bean without modifying its code.
•	Example: Adding extra logging or validation to a service bean by implementing custom logic in BeanPostProcessor.
9. Command Pattern
•	Definition: Encapsulates a request as an object, enabling parameterization and queuing of requests.
•	Usage in Spring: Often seen in Spring Batch and task management systems where jobs or tasks need to be executed, canceled, or retried.
•	Example: Encapsulating a task in a job class in Spring Batch that can be scheduled, retried, or managed independently.
10. Adapter Pattern
•	Definition: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by creating an intermediary.
•	Usage in Spring: Seen in cases where a component with a different interface needs to work with Spring beans.
•	Example: HandlerAdapter in Spring MVC that adapts different handler types (e.g., Controller, RequestMapping) to be processed by the DispatcherServlet.
